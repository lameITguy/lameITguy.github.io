WWF: Walrus Haulout Striking Example of Climate Change Impacts  </div>

    In response to reports that <a href="lameITguy.github.io/a.html">Pacific walrus</a> are hauled out along <a href="file:///Users/Erin/Desktop/Press%20Release%20Nonlinear/alaska.html">Alaska's </a>shores due to <a href="file:///Users/Erin/Desktop/Press%20Release%20Nonlinear/c.html">lack</a> of their <a href="file:///Users/Erin/Desktop/Press%20Release%20Nonlinear/d.html">sea ice habitat</a>, World Wildlife Fund issued the following statement from Margaret Williams, managing director of <a href="file:///Users/Erin/Desktop/Press%20Release%20Nonlinear/e.html">US Arctic programs:</a></div>

      "Pacific walrus are now on <a href="lameITguy.github.io/f.html">the move</a> as the sea ice <a href="lameITguy.github.io/g.html">has disappeared</a> from their <a href="lameITguy.github.io/f.html">preferred feeding areas.</a>  With this year's <a href="lameITguy.github.io/h.html">low summer sea ice extent,</a>  it's not surprising to see walrus beginning to haul out on shore looking for a place to rest."

      "The sharp decline of Arctic sea ice over the last decade is leading to <a href="lameITguy.github.io/i.html">major changes for wildlife</a> and communites alike. The Arctic is experiencing the <a href="lameITguy.github.io/j.html">brunt of climate change</a> like no other region, warming<a href="lameITguy.github.io/k.html"> twice as fast</a> as the rest of the planet. As president Obama makes his way to the Arctic next week, these walrus haulouts are a sticking example of climate change's immediate impacts on wildlife. Such extreme events are a stark reminder of the <a href="lameITguy.github.io/l.html">urgent need to rachet down the emissions</a> that are warming our planet."
